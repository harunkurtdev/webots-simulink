Customizing the Bridge
=====================
The bridge is a crucial component of Webots, responsible for connecting the simulation environment with your custom code. It allows you to interact with the simulation world and retrieve data from it. The bridge provides an interface between the simulation environment and your custom code.

### This will be Changed

## Introduction
In Webots, the bridge plays a vital role in enabling communication between the simulation environment and your custom code. It acts as a conduit for data exchange, allowing you to interact with the simulation world and retrieve information from it. The bridge provides an interface between the simulation environment and your custom code.

## How to Use the Bridge
To use the bridge effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Include the Bridge Header:** Include the `bridge.h` header file in your custom code to access the bridge functionalities.
2. **Initialize the Bridge:** Initialize the bridge by calling the `init_bridge()` function before using any other bridge functions.
3. **Connect to the Simulation Environment:** Connect to the simulation environment by calling the `connect_to_simulation()` function.
4. **Retrieve Data from the Simulation World:** Use the bridge functions to retrieve data from the simulation world, such as positions, velocities, and forces.
5. **Send Commands to the Simulation World:** Send commands to the simulation world using the bridge functions, such as setting joint angles or applying forces.
6. **Disconnect from the Simulation Environment:** Disconnect from the simulation environment by calling the `disconnect_from_simulation()` function when you are done with your custom code.
7. **Clean Up:** Clean up any resources used by the bridge by calling the `cleanup_bridge()` function.
