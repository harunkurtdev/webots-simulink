### How to Debug the Control Architecture Simulink Block

#### 1. Understand the Problem
- Start by clearly defining what "debugging" means in the context of the Simulink block
- Reproduce the issue you're trying to debug
- Use scopes and displays within Simulink to visualize signals

#### 2. Use Debugging Tools
- Add breakpoints to your Simulink model
- Step through the simulation using the Step-by-Step solver
- Examine workspace variables at different time steps
- Use the Display block to output signal values

#### 3. Log and Monitor Signals
- Create subsystems to isolate different parts of your control architecture
- Add To Workspace blocks to capture signals for post-simulation analysis
- Plot signals using scopes or MATLAB figures

#### 4. Check Model Configuration
- Verify solver settings (absolute/relative tolerance, step size)
- Ensure proper data types and sample times are set
- Check for algebraic loops and potential zero-crossing issues

#### 5. When Stuck
- Clear the workspace and start fresh
- Run a smaller, simplified version of your model
- Seek help from colleagues or online forums

By following these steps, you can systematically identify and resolve issues within your Simulink control architecture blocks.
